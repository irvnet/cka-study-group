#Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Study Group

We're a small group with a common interest in passing the [CKA](https://www.cncf.io/certification/expert/). We all have a belief that there's lots of value in understanding distributed systems, containers and container orchestration for the betterment of development and operations, however most of us are working with customers in some capacity and have both a need, and personal interest in learning deep skills in the platform. 

The study group revolves around the [CNCF Exam Curriculum repository ](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum) and as we review the content for each segment, we'll look for creative ways to practice the skills from the segment under review, or identify and fill in gaps in our understanding until we can demonstrate hands on facility with the segment under review.
